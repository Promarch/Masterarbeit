This repository was created during the six month of the master's thesis. 
The main functions are found in the mjctrl and the Cmake folder. 

In the mjctrl folder, the file fr3_impedance simulates impedance control on the FR3 robot, and the file joint_copy_robot recreates past movement and displays the desired orientation. 

The Cmake folder contains all control algorithm, the main one being First_ImpedanceVel. The manual mode of the robot is implemented in the file HandMoveRobot.
